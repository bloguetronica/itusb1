.TH ITUSB1-DETACH 1
.SH NAME
itusb1-detach \- disconnect device from host via ITUSB1 USB Test Switch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B itusb1-detach
.RI [ SERIALNUMBER ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B itusb1-detach
disconnects the device under test (DUT) from the host that is currently
plugged into the the USB test switch upstream port. In essence, when in a
connected state, the USB test switch will emulate a manual detachment. It does
that by first disconnecting the data lines between host and device, and then
by disconnecting the VBUS line, after 100ms. However, note that this command
will have no effect if the switch is already in a fully disconnected state.
Conversely, you can invoke
.B itusb1-attach
to connect or reconnect the DUT. You can also verify the connection status by
calling
.BR itusb1-status .

Specifying a serial number is optional.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with a status of zero in case of success. Returns one should an error
occur.
