.TH ITUSB1-STATUS 1
.SH NAME
itusb1-status \- show ITUSB1 USB Test Switch status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B itusb1-status
.RI [ SERIALNUMBER ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B itusb1-status
shows the status of the USB test switch, giving detailed information. You can
use
.B itusb1-status
to see which lines are connected or to measure the current being consumed by
the device under test (DUT). This command will also indicate if the
consumption current exceeds the 500mA limit as per the USB 2.0 specification,
by displaying "(OC)" next to the value. Note that, if the current meets or
exceeds 1000mA, the value will be displayed as "out of limits" by the use of
the acronym "OL". In that case, the possible over-current condition might trip
the inbuilt current limit protection, triggering a generic fault warning as
well.

Specifying a serial number is optional.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with a status of zero in case of success. Returns one should an error
occur.
